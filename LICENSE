                            Preamble

What are you even doing here?

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Do what you want with this.

  1. Actually, though, why would you even look for anything potentially remotely useful in this repository? There is genuinely nothing there for you to find.

  2. On a second thought, that is so annoying that aside from allowing you to do absolutely whatever you want with this code here, I guarantee you that if you do, I will simply curse you so that you have bad luck for the rest of your life and then go to super-hell in the afterlife.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
